         <p>
        A warehouse may be defined as a place used for the storage or accumulation of goods. The function of storage can be carried out successful with the help of warehouses used for storing the goods.
    </p>

        <p class="desc">
                These warehouses cater to the government’s own storage needs but can also be used by the general public through rental. However, if a business is unable to pay their dues on time, the government has the authority to recover their rent by selling off their goods. These warehouses are owned, managed, and operated by governments or public authorities.

            <p class="desc">
                Bonded warehouses can store imported dutiable goods for a fixed amount of time without paying duties. When the goods are released for consumption, the payment of import duties, taxes, and other charges are collected by the proprietor who holds the liability. But when the goods are exported, drafted to be used in international traffic, or destroyed under the Customs and Border Protection’s supervision, liability is canceled, and no duties are collected.

            <p class="desc">
               A cross-dock warehouse involves the transfer of goods from an inbound carrier to an outbound carrier, with little to no storage time. When goods arrive at a cross-dock warehouse, they directly go through the sorting process instead of getting stored. The large deliveries are broken up into groups according to their destination, usually the retail store, to be transported by a single truck. Without cross-docking, multiple trucks would need to deliver all the goods destined for one location. See the image below for a graphical explanation.

                Temperature-controlled warehouses maintain the temperature within a set range so that the quality of the goods remains intact. These warehouses utilize strategically placed cooling or heating units, and the requirement can vary depending on factors such as seasons and characteristics of products stored.
